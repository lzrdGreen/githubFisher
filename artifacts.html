    <h1>Artifacts</h1>
    <p>Project artifacts are tangible documents created throughout the project lifecycle to manage and communicate project details. They serve as a portfolio of work, showcasing both planning and execution skills.</p>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #1f78b4;">
    <h2>Google Project Management Certificate Capstone</h2>
    <p>As part of the Google Project Management Certificate program, I developed a comprehensive set of project artifacts for a hypothetical project, demonstrating a practical understanding of project initiation and planning. These documents showcase my ability to define project goals, scope, and stakeholders, while ensuring a project is set up for success from the outset.</p>
    <h3>Initiation Phase:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong>A high-level document used to pitch the project idea and secure initial buy-in. It highlights the problem/opportunity, proposed solution, and expected benefits in broad terms. The proposal for this capstone was provided in the course materials (Module 1 of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management">Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World</a>) and served as the foundation for subsequent documents</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Business Case with Statement of Work (SOW): </strong>A foundational document that justifies the project’s financial and strategic value. It includes a benefits analysis, risk considerations, and an initial Statement of Work, which defines the scope and deliverables</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Purpose: </strong>Provides the sponsor(s) with enough detail to decide whether to invest in the project</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Approval: </strong>Requires sponsor/governance approval before moving forward</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and ROI: </strong>A financial evaluation tool that systematically compares a project’s expected costs against its anticipated benefits. The CBA provides quantitative data to justify whether a project is worth pursuing and often serves as the foundation for securing funding approval. A critical metric within this analysis is the Return on Investment (ROI) - a standard corporate finance measure that quantifies the value a project is expected to generate relative to its cost. ROI calculations can include both <strong>tangible outcomes </strong>(such as revenue growth, cost savings, and efficiency gains) and <strong>intangible benefits </strong>(such as improved brand awareness, customer satisfaction, or employee morale), though the latter may require informed judgment to quantify effectively. Together, the CBA and ROI provide sponsors, project managers, and stakeholders with a clear view of the project’s financial viability, resource requirements, and associated risks, enabling informed decision-making</p></li>
        <li><p><strong><a href="charter.html">Charter:</a> </strong>A formal authorisation document that officially empowers the project manager to begin planning and execution. It outlines the project’s purpose, goals, deliverables, success criteria, and governance structure. The Charter includes a condensed Business Case summary and must be <strong>approved and signed </strong>by the sponsor(s) and key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and organisational commitment</p></li>      
        <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Register: </strong>A document that identifies and analyses all relevant stakeholders, detailing their roles, level of influence, and communication needs. Beyond simply listing stakeholders, this analysis helps the project manager prioritise individuals and groups based on their interest in the project and their power to influence outcomes. By mapping and prioritising stakeholders, the project manager can tailor communication strategies, engage proactively, and secure stakeholder buy-in. This alignment reduces resistance, mitigates risks, and ensures that the project team delivers outcomes that truly address stakeholder needs. Ultimately, an effective stakeholder register supports collaboration, transparency, and the successful achievement of project objectives</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why Initiation Matters</h4>
    <p>The initiation phase lays the foundation for the entire project. Without strong initiation artifacts, projects are far more likely to encounter serious issues, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays: </strong>Weak initial planning often leads to budgets and timelines being exceeded</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Scope Creep: </strong>An unclear or poorly defined scope makes it difficult to control changes, complicating project management</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Discontent: </strong>Misaligned expectations and poor communication increase the risk of conflict and dissatisfaction</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Project Failure: </strong>In extreme cases, inadequate initiation can result in outright project cancellation, financial loss, or reputational damage</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>By establishing clear goals, scope, and stakeholder alignment from the outset, the initiation phase creates the conditions for successful planning and execution.</p>

    <h3>Planning Phase:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Project Management Plan: </strong>A comprehensive roadmap for executing, monitoring, and controlling the project. It integrates the Scope Statement, Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), Budget, Schedule, Risk Register, and Communication Plan into a single framework that guides the project team and informs stakeholders.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p><strong>Integration for Control: </strong>By linking what will be done (Scope), how it will be structured (WBS), and what it will cost (Budget), the PMP provides the project manager with a powerful tool for monitoring performance and making data-driven decisions</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Baseline for Execution: </strong>The PMP establishes baselines for scope, time, and cost, allowing the project manager to measure progress and report transparently. The WBS doubles as a checklist of deliverables, while the budget ensures each work package is properly resourced</p></li>
          <li><p><strong>Change Management: </strong>When change requests arise, the PMP provides a structured way to assess impact. The WBS shows which tasks are affected, while the Budget and Schedule reveal cost and time implications. This allows the project manager to balance flexibility with control and to prevent uncontrolled scope creep</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>Ultimately, the Project Management Plan ensures alignment, accountability, and transparency, turning the project’s vision into a controlled, measurable reality.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Scope Statement: </strong>The Scope Statement defines the boundaries of the project by specifying inclusions (what will be delivered), exclusions (what is out of scope), assumptions, acceptance criteria, and constraints. It provides a clear understanding of what success looks like and what lies outside the project’s responsibility. This clarity prevents scope creep by aligning expectations early and ensuring stakeholders agree on the project’s deliverables. The Scope Statement also serves as the baseline for developing the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), linking high-level objectives to detailed tasks and milestones</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Work Breakdown Structure (WBS): </strong>Breaks down the project scope into smaller, more manageable components or deliverables. A well-defined WBS provides a clear, hierarchical view of the project, which is essential for effective management. It defines and organises project scope preventing scope creep. It allows for "bottom-up" approach to planning resources and time which leads to more accurate and realistic schedules and budgets. By linking tasks to specific individuals or teams, the WBS promotes accountability. Milestones are directly linked to the WBS. This allows the project manager to easily monitor their completion, i.e. to monitor the progress</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Project Schedule and Budget: </strong>Establishes timelines and financial limits for the project. The project schedule outlines activities, durations, dependencies, and milestones, while the budget establishes resource costs, contingency reserves, and tracking mechanisms. Together, they define two critical components of the project management “triple constraint” (scope, time, and cost). Creating a realistic schedule requires a combination of detail, collaboration, and proactive planning. Best practices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Developing a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) to capture all required work</p></li>
          <li><p>Involving the project team in time and resource estimation to improve accuracy</p></li>
          <li><p>Identifying task dependencies to establish logical sequencing</p></li>
          <li><p>Considering resource availability to prevent bottlenecks</p></li>
          <li><p>Building in contingency time to account for uncertainties</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A well-structured schedule reduces uncertainty, improves communication, and enables proactive monitoring of progress.</p>
        <p>The Project Budget defines the financial resources required to deliver the project. It includes direct costs (labour, materials, equipment), indirect costs (overheads, administration), and contingency reserves for risk and uncertainty. Effective budgeting practices include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>Linking costs to the WBS so each work package is properly resourced</p></li>
          <li><p>Collaborating with team members and functional managers to validate estimates</p></li>
          <li><p>Accounting for variable costs (e.g., hourly labour, fluctuating material prices) and fixed costs</p></li>
          <li><p>Including contingency and management reserves to handle unforeseen risks</p></li>
          <li><p>Establishing cost tracking mechanisms ((such as variance analysis, budget burn rate, or Earned Value Management in more complex projects) to monitor actual vs planned spending</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p>A realistic budget prevents underfunding or overspending, ensures resource alignment, and provides a baseline for financial control.</p>
        <p>Together, the schedule and budget provide a roadmap for execution and a benchmark for monitoring performance. By integrating timelines with financial planning, the project manager can make informed, data-driven decisions and maintain stakeholder confidence throughout the project lifecycle.</p>
      </li>
      <li><p><strong>Risk Register: </strong>Lists potential risks, their probabilities, impacts, and mitigation strategies. The Risk Register identifies potential threats and opportunities that could affect project success. Risks are organised into categories such as technical, external, and organisational, then evaluated through qualitative (e.g., probability and impact scoring) and, when appropriate, quantitative (e.g., simulations, cost exposure) methods. Risks are then prioritised using a risk matrix, enabling the project manager to focus on the most significant threats. Because project environments change, the Risk Register is iterative: it is updated regularly to reflect new risks, mitigation strategies, and lessons learned. Maintaining this living document promotes proactive risk management, helping the project team minimise negative impacts and capitalise on potential opportunities</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Communication Plan: </strong>Specifies how and when information will be shared among stakeholders and the project team. It ensures all stakeholders are informed and aligned. It prevents misunderstandings, reduces conflicts, and ensures that the right information reaches the right people at the right time.  Elements of a Communication Plan: Stakeholder Identification; their Information Requirements; Communication Channels; Frequency and Timing. We also need to understand who is responsible for each communication task</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>The planning phase transforms a project's high-level concept into a detailed, actionable blueprint. It serves as the project's roadmap, defining exactly how the team will achieve the project's goals. Without a solid plan projects often fail due to a lack of clear direction, miscommunication, and poor resource allocation. This phase ensures alignment between stakeholders, secures realistic timelines and budgets, and establishes a clear risk and communication framework — providing the foundation for effective execution and control.</p>

    <h3>Execution Phase:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Status Reports: </strong>Communicate project progress to stakeholders.</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Issue Log: </strong>Tracks and manages problems that arise during the project</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Change Request Log: </strong>Documents changes to the original scope, schedule, or budget to prevent scope creep</p></li>      
    </ul>
    <hr style="border: 1px solid #1f78b4;">
    <h3>Closing Phase:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Project Closure Report: </strong>Summarises project outcomes and performance</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Lessons Learned: </strong>Captures insights and experiences from the project for future reference</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Final Deliverable Sign-off: </strong>Confirms acceptance of the project's deliverables</p></li>      
    </ul>
