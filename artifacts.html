    <h1>Artifacts</h1>
    <p>Project Artifacts are tangible documents you create throughout the project lifecycle to manage and communicate project details.  They serve as a portfolio of work, showcasing your ability to plan and execute projects.</p>

    <h2>Google Project Management Certificate Capstone</h2>
    <p>As part of the Google Project Management Certificate program, I developed a full set of project artifacts for a hypothetical project, demonstrating a practical understanding of project initiation and planning. These documents showcase my ability to define project goals, scope, manage stakeholders, and ensuring a project is set up for success from the outset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong><a href="charter.html">Charter:</a> </strong>A formal document that formally authorises the project and outlines the project's purpose, goals, deliverables, and success criteria. It serves as an official framework, ensuring alignment among all stakeholders before planning begins.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Business Case with Statement of Work (SOW): </strong>A foundational document that justifies the project's financial and strategic value to the business. It includes a benefits analysis and an initial Statement of Work, which outlines the project's scope and deliverables to be approved before the project moves forward.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong>A high-level document used to pitch the project idea to key stakeholders and secure initial buy-in.  The project proposal for this capstone was provided as a part of the course materials. For a detailed review, the document is available for free audit in Module 1 of the Google <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management">Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World</a>.</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Register: </strong>A key document that identifies and analyses all relevant stakeholders, detailing their roles, level of influence, and communication needs. This ensures effective stakeholder management throughout the project.</p></li>
