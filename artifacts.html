    <h1>Artifacts</h1>
    <p>Project artifacts are tangible documents created throughout the project lifecycle to manage and communicate project details. They serve as a portfolio of work, showcasing both planning and execution skills.</p>

    <h2>Google Project Management Certificate Capstone</h2>
    <p>As part of the Google Project Management Certificate program, I developed a comprehensive set of project artifacts for a hypothetical project, demonstrating a practical understanding of project initiation and planning. These documents showcase my ability to define project goals, scope, and stakeholders, while ensuring a project is set up for success from the outset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong>A high-level document used to pitch the project idea and secure initial buy-in. It highlights the problem/opportunity, proposed solution, and expected benefits in broad terms. The proposal for this capstone was provided in the course materials (Module 1 of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management">Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World</a>) and served as the foundation for subsequent documents</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Business Case with Statement of Work (SOW): </strong>A foundational document that justifies the project’s financial and strategic value. It includes a benefits analysis, risk considerations, and an initial Statement of Work, which defines the scope and deliverables</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Purpose: </strong>Provides the sponsor(s) with enough detail to decide whether to invest in the project</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Approval: </strong>Requires sponsor/governance approval before moving forward</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong>Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) and ROI: </strong>A financial evaluation tool that systematically compares a project’s expected costs against its anticipated benefits. The CBA provides quantitative data to justify whether a project is worth pursuing and often serves as the foundation for securing funding approval. A critical metric within this analysis is the Return on Investment (ROI) - a standard corporate finance measure that quantifies the value a project is expected to generate relative to its cost. ROI calculations can include both <strong>tangible outcomes </strong>(such as revenue growth, cost savings, and efficiency gains) and <strong>intangible benefits </strong>(such as improved brand awareness, customer satisfaction, or employee morale), though the latter may require informed judgment to quantify effectively. Together, the CBA and ROI provide sponsors, project managers, and stakeholders with a clear view of the project’s financial viability, resource requirements, and associated risks, enabling informed decision-making</p></li>
        <li><p><strong><a href="charter.html">Charter:</a> </strong>A formal authorisation document that officially empowers the project manager to begin planning and execution. It outlines the project’s purpose, goals, deliverables, success criteria, and governance structure. The Charter includes a condensed Business Case summary and must be <strong>approved and signed </strong>by the sponsor(s) and key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and organisational commitment</p></li>      
        <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Register: </strong>A document that identifies and analyses all relevant stakeholders, detailing their roles, level of influence, and communication needs. Beyond simply listing stakeholders, this analysis helps the project manager prioritise individuals and groups based on their interest in the project and their power to influence outcomes. By mapping and prioritising stakeholders, the project manager can tailor communication strategies, engage proactively, and secure stakeholder buy-in. This alignment reduces resistance, mitigates risks, and ensures that the project team delivers outcomes that truly address stakeholder needs. Ultimately, an effective stakeholder register supports collaboration, transparency, and the successful achievement of project objectives</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Why Initiation Matters</h4>
    <p>The initiation phase lays the foundation for the entire project. Without strong initiation artifacts, projects are far more likely to encounter serious issues, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><p><strong>Cost Overruns and Schedule Delays: </strong>Weak initial planning often leads to budgets and timelines being exceeded</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Scope Creep: </strong>An unclear or poorly defined scope makes it difficult to control changes, complicating project management</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Discontent: </strong>Misaligned expectations and poor communication increase the risk of conflict and dissatisfaction</p></li>
      <li><p><strong>Project Failure: </strong>In extreme cases, inadequate initiation can result in outright project cancellation, financial loss, or reputational damage</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>By establishing clear goals, scope, and stakeholder alignment from the outset, the initiation phase creates the conditions for successful planning and execution.</p>
