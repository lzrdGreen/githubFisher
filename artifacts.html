    <h1>Artifacts</h1>
    <p>Project artifacts are tangible documents created throughout the project lifecycle to manage and communicate project details. They serve as a portfolio of work, showcasing both planning and execution skills.</p>

    <h2>Google Project Management Certificate Capstone</h2>
    <p>As part of the Google Project Management Certificate program, I developed a comprehensive set of project artifacts for a hypothetical project, demonstrating a practical understanding of project initiation and planning. These documents showcase my ability to define project goals, scope, and stakeholders, while ensuring a project is set up for success from the outset.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Project Proposal: </strong>A high-level document used to pitch the project idea and secure initial buy-in. It highlights the problem/opportunity, proposed solution, and expected benefits in broad terms. The proposal for this capstone was provided in the course materials (Module 1 of <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/applying-project-management">Capstone: Applying Project Management in the Real World</a>) and served as the foundation for subsequent documents</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Business Case with Statement of Work (SOW): </strong>A foundational document that justifies the project’s financial and strategic value. It includes a benefits analysis, risk considerations, and an initial Statement of Work, which defines the scope and deliverables</p>
          <ul>
            <li><p><strong>Purpose: </strong>Provides the sponsor(s) with enough detail to decide whether to invest in the project</p></li>
            <li><p><strong>Approval: </strong>Requires sponsor/governance approval before moving forward</p></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><p><strong><a href="charter.html">Charter:</a> </strong>A formal authorisation document that officially empowers the project manager to begin planning and execution. It outlines the project’s purpose, goals, deliverables, success criteria, and governance structure. The Charter includes a condensed Business Case summary and must be <strong>approved and signed </strong>by the sponsor(s) and key stakeholders, ensuring alignment and organisational commitment</p></li>      
        <li><p><strong>Stakeholder Register: </strong>A document that identifies and analyses all relevant stakeholders, detailing their roles, level of influence, and communication needs. It ensures stakeholder expectations are effectively managed throughout the project</p></li>
