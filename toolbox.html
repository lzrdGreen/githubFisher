    <p>I believe effective project management tools should empower people - not overwhelm them. Many existing platforms are designed for large enterprises, packed with features that small teams and freelancers rarely need. This complexity often slows down rather than supports productivity.</p>
    <p>To explore a better way, I designed and developed a streamlined Project Management System (PMS). My goal was to create a tool that reflects my project management philosophy: <strong>simplicity, usability, and practical value.</strong></p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>
    <p>While there are many capable free project management tools available, like Trello or Asana, I wanted to explore a fundamental question: What would a project management system look like if I designed it from scratch to embody my own philosophy? This became an exercise in creating a free alternative that translates my core beliefs into a working system.</p>
    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>I built a lightweight Project Management System using Django that strips away unnecessary complexity while keeping essential functionality. The system provides intuitive task and project management with dual viewing options (list and board views), task prioritisation, keyword search, and tag-based filtering - delivering exactly what small teams need without the bloat.</p>
    <h3>The Impact</h3>
    <p>By stripping away unnecessary complexity, this system demonstrates how thoughtful design can improve workflows, encourage adoption, and keep projects on track. It embodies the principle that the right tool is not the one with the most features, but the one that best supports the team’s goals.</p>
    <p>To take the project further, I applied a replatforming strategy (“lift, tinker, and shift”) to migrate the system onto AWS. This approach ensured the tool could scale more reliably and benefit from cloud infrastructure. The live demo was decommissioned in November 2025 to conclude the project's AWS Free Tier phase. The full source code is still available for review here: <a href="https://github.com/lzrdGreen/api-pms/">https://github.com/lzrdGreen/api-pms/</a></p>
