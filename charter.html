    <p><strong>Project Name: </strong>Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout (Pilot Project)</p>
    <p><strong>Project Manager: </strong>Peta (In-house PM)</p>
    <p><strong>Project Sponsor: </strong>Omar Mubarak (Owner of Sauce & Spoon)</p>
    <p><strong>Date: </strong>09 September 2025</p>
    <h3>1. Project Summary</h3>
    <p>The Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout Pilot Project aims to pilot tabletop menu tablets in the bar areas of its North and Downtown locations. The tablets will allow customers to place orders and pay directly, reducing wait times, increasing table turnover, and creating opportunities for upselling menu items. The project seeks to improve the customer dining experience, boost profitability by reducing food waste and increasing order size, and gather operational data to inform a full rollout. The successful pilot will support the company's long-term goals for growth and customer satisfaction. </p>
    <h3>2. Project Goals and Objectives</h3>
    <h4>Goal 1: Improve restaurant efficiency and guest satisfaction.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Reduce average table turn time by ~30 minutes (through faster ordering and checkout processes) and reduce negative reviews mentioning "slow service" by 50%, both by the end of Q2 </p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Increase daily guest counts by 10% at pilot locations (North and Downtown) by the end of Q2, supported by faster turnover and streamlined service</p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Reduce food waste and comped meals by 25% by the end of Q2 through more accurate order capture and clearer kitchen communication</p></li>

    <h4>Goal 2: Boost sales, profit margins, and product mix.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Raise the average check total from $65 to $75 across pilot locations by the end of Q2, through promoting appetisers, entrées, add-ons, and coupons via tablets</p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Boost appetiser sales by an average of 15% by the end of Q2, adjusted by location (10% at North, 20% at Downtown)</p></li>

    </ul>
    <h4>Goal 4: Evaluate pilot success to inform future rollouts.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Gather and analyse pilot data (table turn, guest counts, check totals, appetiser sales, waste reduction, upsell rates) and deliver evaluation report by 01 July</p></li>
