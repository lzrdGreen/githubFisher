    <p><strong>Project Name: </strong>Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout (Pilot Project)</p>
    <p><strong>Project Manager: </strong>Peta (In-house PM)</p>
    <p><strong>Project Sponsor: </strong>Omar Mubarak (Owner of Sauce & Spoon)</p>
    <p><strong>Date: </strong>09 September 2025</p>
    <h3>1. Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>The Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout Pilot Project aims to pilot tabletop menu tablets in the bar areas of its North and Downtown locations. The tablets will allow customers to place orders and pay directly, reducing wait times, increasing table turnover, and creating opportunities for upselling menu items. The project seeks to improve the customer dining experience, boost profitability by reducing food waste and increasing order size, and gather operational data to inform a full rollout. The successful pilot will support the company's long-term goals for growth and customer satisfaction. </p>
    <h3>2. Project Goals and Objectives</h3>
    <h4>Goal 1: Improve restaurant efficiency and guest satisfaction.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Reduce average table turn time by ~30 minutes (through faster ordering and checkout processes) resulting in decreased customer wait times and reduce negative reviews mentioning "slow/ delay in service" by 50%, both by the end of Q2 </p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Increase daily guest counts by 10% at pilot locations (North and Downtown) by the end of Q2, supported by faster turnover and streamlined service</p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Reduce food waste and comped meals by 25% by the end of Q2 through more accurate order capture and clearer kitchen communication</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Goal 2: Boost sales, profit margins, and product mix.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Raise the average check total from $65 to $75 across pilot locations by the end of Q2, through promoting appetisers, entrées, specialty beverages, add-ons, and coupons via tablets</p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Boost appetiser sales by an average of 15% by the end of Q2, adjusted by location (10% at North, 20% at Downtown)</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Goal 3: Ensure smooth technology adoption and integration.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Seamlessly integrate tablets with POS and host systems by 01 April</p></li>
        <li><p>Objective: Train 100% of FOH staff by 31 March to reduce technology resistance, staff burnout, and turnover</p></li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Goal 4: Evaluate pilot success to inform future rollouts.</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><p>Objective: Gather and analyse pilot data (table turn, guest counts, check totals, appetiser sales, waste reduction, upsell rates) and deliver evaluation report by 01 July</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Business Case</h3>
    <h4> The Problem:</h4>
    <p>Despite a 28% annual growth in sales and an increase in new restaurant locations, Sauce & Spoon's business model is facing several key challenges that threaten profitability and sustainability. Internal data reveals a 20% increase in order wait times, directly correlated with a rise in negative customer satisfaction reviews mentioning "delay in service." Additionally, the company is experiencing high employee turnover (a 50% reduction in front-of-house staff) due to "burnout" and human error in ticketing, which also risks profitability.</p>
    <h4> The Opportunity:</h4>
    <p>Sauce & Spoon has a significant opportunity to address these operational inefficiencies by embracing a digital solution. By implementing a new technology, the company can streamline the ordering process while simultaneously raising the average check total from $65 to $75, promote add-ons and coupons, reduce human error, food waste, and comped meals, and provide valuable data to help improve operations. This initiative provides a chance to not only keep pace with industry trends but also to directly tackle the root causes of slow service and staff turnover, which have led to flat profit margins despite growing sales.</p>
    <h4>The Proposed Solution:</h4>
    <p>Implement a fully integrated, guest-facing tablet system in the bar areas. This digital menu and point-of-sale (POS) system will provide customers with a seamless, quick ordering experience, give the restaurant a more effective ticketing process, speed up service, allow for faster table turnover, and capture clear data points to track key metrics.  The tablets will seamlessly integrate with the existing POS and host systems.</p>
    <p>This project directly supports Sauce & Spoon’s mission to provide quick, fresh, community-focused dining while ensuring sustainable profitability and growth.</p>
    <h3>5. Scope</h3>
    <h4>In Scope:</h4>

        <p><strong>Stakeholders: </strong>Deanna, Peta, Gilly (North GM), Alex (Downtown GM)</p>
        <p><strong>Misalignment: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Peta felt the goal to reduce guest wait time was redundant with the table turn time goal</p></li>
            <li><p>Gilly noted wait time also depends on demand, not just table turn</p></li>
            <li><p>Alex agreed to remove the goal</p></li>

            <li><p>Gilly argued tablets would not significantly impact appetiser sales at her location</p></li>
            <li><p>Alex suggested a 20% increase at his location</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Clarification / Discussion:</strong></p>

        <p><strong>Misalignment: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Alex wanted to reallocate FOH savings to expand BOH staff (line cooks, bussers, runners)</p></li>
            <li><p>Peta felt more data was needed before making staffing decisions</p></li>
            <li><p>Gilly was hesitant to reduce FOH payroll (hosts, bartenders)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Clarification / Discussion: </strong>Agreement that broader reallocation should wait until tablet data is available</p>
        <p><strong>Final Decision / Resolution: </strong>No immediate change beyond two part-time cooks (see Item #2)</p>

        <p><strong>Stakeholders: </strong>Peta (Project Manager), Carter (Executive Chef), Gilly (General Manager, North), Alex (General Manager, Downtown), Deanna (Director of Operations)</p>
        <p><strong>Misalignment: </strong>Carter assumed that changing the policy on order returns due to customer error was part of the project’s scope. Other stakeholders viewed it as an operational decision outside of the tablet rollout.</p>
        <p><strong>Clarification / Discussion:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Carter argued that a policy change was necessary to meet the food waste reduction goal</p></li>
            <li><p>Gilly raised concerns that it would negatively affect service staff and the guest experience</p></li>
            <li><p>Peta clarified that project managers are not responsible for company-wide policy revisions</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Decision / Resolution: </strong>All parties agreed that the policy change is out of scope for the tablet project</p>
        <p><strong>Next Steps: </strong>Deanna and Carter will address the policy change separately through operations discussions</p>
        <li><h4>Kitchen Staff Satisfaction</h4></li>
        <p><strong>Source: </strong>[Meeting on Scope Details]</p>

        <p><strong>Misalignment: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Carter wanted to include a goal to improve kitchen staff satisfaction in the project charter</p></li>
            <li><p>Peta was hesitant because the benefit was not clearly defined or easily measurable</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Clarification / Discussion: </strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>Peta questioned how to quantify “satisfaction” and expressed concern about adding a vague objective</p></li>
            <li><p>Carter emphasised the importance of including it, citing staff morale and turnover concerns</p></li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Final Decision / Resolution: </strong>It was agreed that improving kitchen staff satisfaction may be included in the project scope, provided Carter can supply specific, measurable metrics</p>
        <p><strong>Next Steps: </strong>Carter will work with Peta to define measurable metrics for the new objective. Once available, Peta will amend the charter</p>
