    <h1>Sauce & Spoon Risk Management Plan (2026)</h1>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of this document is to define and analyse the major risks to the Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout Pilot and establish the necessary plans to mitigate their potential negative impact on the project's budget, schedule, and success criteria.</p>

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>Sauce & Spoon is launching the <strong>Tablet Rollout Pilot Project</strong> in the bar areas of its North and Downtown locations over a 13-week period. The pilot aims to enhance operational efficiency by reducing wait times, increasing table turnover, and boosting average check totals through the integration of guest-facing ordering tablets with existing POS and host systems.</p>
    <p>This Risk Management Plan identifies and assesses the key risks that could impact the project’s success, focusing on three primary categories: <strong>budget, schedule,</strong> and <strong>operational/ adoption</strong> risks. The following tables outline these risks in detail, along with mitigation strategies designed to minimise their likelihood and potential impact.</p>

    <p><strong>RISK TYPE ONE:</strong> You are at risk of going over budget</p>

                <td><strong>(CRITICAL RISK)</strong> <strong>Minimise &amp; Accept.</strong> To minimise impact from attrition, establish a decentralised training system and stabilise the team proactively. HR communicates that tablets support staff, not replace them (addressing job security), and implements a pilot participation bonus to increase retention. Create a 24/7 digital knowledge base using 10-minute micro-training videos, quizzes, and laminated quick guides. Allocate a dedicated £3,000 budget for continuous retraining. Schedule a weekly peer-led refresher mini-session for new hires. Each GM trains one shift supervisor as a “tablet lead” for on-the-job reinforcement and as contingency for key staff loss.</td>
                <td><strong>Example:</strong> Prior to the 1 June pilot launch, HR finalises and communicates the job security messaging and the pilot participation bonus structure to stabilise FOH staff; the PM and GMs must designate the  FOH Tablet Trainers and finalise all quick-reference cards and micro-training videos. The designated Tablet Trainers will then conduct the mandatory 15-minute weekly refresher sessions every Thursday for new hires, logging all attendance and hours against the £3,000 budget for cost control. Simultaneously, HR integrates the online modules into the standard onboarding process, requiring new staff to complete them before their first shift for better data tracking and compliance. </td>

Key actions: Create a Data Collection Checklist defining the exact metrics (e.g., table turn time, average check total) and corresponding measurement procedures. Implement redundant collection using automated system reports plus manual verification by GMs through daily spot-checks. Minimise configuration errors by requiring Seydou and IT to conduct a Pre-Launch Data Validation Test after integration but before the 20 May staff training. The PM and Seydou will conduct weekly Data Quality Reviews, with the Finance team verifying financial metrics once at the end of the pilot to confirm accuracy before the final decision.</td>

During the June 5–26 data collection period, the PM and Seydou will conduct a weekly Data Quality Review, flagging any data discrepancies over 2% for an immediate IT/vendor fix within 48 hours, while the Finance team verifies financial metrics once by 1 July.</td>

Legal and Procurement will negotiate strong contractual protections, including a technology escrow clause with guarantees to release the source code and documentation upon vendor failure, guaranteed SLA response times with financial penalties, and explicit termination rights. To minimise dependency, the IT Team will document all configurations to build internal capacity. The PM will establish a "Vendor Failure Protocol" that outlines the immediate operational fallback procedure (to manual POS) and the precise thresholds (24 hours of uncorrected downtime) that trigger the executive escalation to the Project Sponsor (Omar). 72 hours of uncorrected downtime triggers the formal request to the Steering Committee to authorise the invocation of contractual termination and review of the escrow clause.</td>

Seydou will conduct two formal knowledge transfer sessions with IT before the pilot launch, ensuring all system configurations are documented and stored centrally. IT documents setup steps and passwords in a shared repository by Week 6 to ensure continuity if vendor support fails. The PM will train GMs on the "Vendor Failure Protocol," outlining the immediate switch to the existing POS system and the process for escalating vendor-related outages that exceed 24 hours.

    <h3>Risk Interdependence</h3>
    <p>To maintain strategic oversight, the Project Team acknowledges the interdependence of risks. A failure in one area can cascade, significantly amplifying impact across the project. Key interdependencies include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><strong>Integration Delays → Hidden Integration Costs → Schedule Slippage: </strong>Delays in POS/host system integration  increase reliance on vendor and consultant support, rapidly consuming the contingency budget. This exposes the project to unforeseen integration costs, which in turn constrain financial flexibility and delay milestone completion. Budget strain and timeline compression could force scope reduction or delay the 06 May integration deadline, impacting data collection and training phases</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>System Downtime → Staff Adoption Failure: </strong>Frequent tablet outages or sync errors erode staff confidence in the new technology. This frustration drives intentional workarounds or avoidance behaviours, directly reinforcing FOH Technology Resistance and Adoption Failure. The pilot may fail to achieve the adoption metrics required for meaningful operational testing and customer engagement goals</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>System Downtime → Data Inaccuracy: </strong>Technical instability pushes staff to revert to manual entry or skip tablet orders during peak hours. These inconsistencies compromise the validity of data collection. Compromised data integrity weakens the reliability of the final evaluation report, jeopardising Project's Goal (Informed Rollout Decision)</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>High Staff Turnover → Adoption Failure → Data Inaccuracy: </strong>Ongoing FOH attrition leads to undertrained replacements, who are less engaged and more likely to avoid new systems. Resistance behaviours and inconsistent tablet usage further increase the probability of incomplete or inaccurate data capture. Reduced staff confidence and data reliability undermine both operational efficiency and the evaluation of pilot outcomes</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Vendor Dependency → Hidden Costs & Reliability Risks: </strong>Heavy reliance on a single vendor for integration and technical support can expose the project to performance gaps or unanticipated fees. While not a standalone top-six risk, vendor dependency can amplify Hidden Integration Costs and Downtime. Vendor instability can simultaneously trigger financial overruns, operational disruptions, and credibility issues with FOH staff</p></li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk Monitoring and Reporting Cadence</h3>
    <p>A formal governance cadence is essential to ensure that project risks are actively managed, tracked, and prevented from escalating into critical issues. The Project Team will maintain continuous visibility of risk exposure through structured review and reporting cycles.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><p><strong>Risk Review: </strong>The master Risk Register will be maintained and updated weekly by the Project Manager. Risk status and any newly identified risks will be reviewed as a standing agenda item during the weekly Project Team Meeting to ensure timely mitigation and accountability</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Risk Status Reporting: </strong>A concise summary of the <b>Top 6 Critical Risks</b> (including status, trend, and mitigation progress) will be prepared monthly and presented to the <b>Project Sponsor and Steering Committee </b>for oversight and decision-making support</p></li>
        <li><p><strong>Escalation Thresholds: </strong>Any risk that (a) moves into the Critical category (High Impact / High Probability), or (b) remains open beyond its agreed mitigation deadline, will be <b>immediately escalated to the Steering Committee</b>. The Committee will determine appropriate intervention measures, including resource reallocation, schedule adjustment, or risk transfer actions</p></li>
