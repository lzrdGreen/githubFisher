    <h1>Sauce & Spoon Risk Management Plan (2026)</h1>
    <h3>Objective</h3>
    <p>The objective of this document is to define and analyse the major risks to the Sauce & Spoon Tablet Rollout Pilot and establish the necessary plans to mitigate their potential negative impact on the project's budget, schedule, and success criteria.</p>

    <h3>Executive Summary</h3>
    <p>Sauce & Spoon is launching the <strong>Tablet Rollout Pilot Project</strong> in the bar areas of its North and Downtown locations over a 13-week period. The pilot aims to enhance operational efficiency by reducing wait times, increasing table turnover, and boosting average check totals through the integration of guest-facing ordering tablets with existing POS and host systems.</p>
    <p>This Risk Management Plan identifies and assesses the key risks that could impact the projectâ€™s success, focusing on three primary categories: <strong>budget, schedule,</strong> and <strong>operational/ adoption</strong> risks. The following tables outline these risks in detail, along with mitigation strategies designed to minimise their likelihood and potential impact.</p>

    <p><strong>RISK TYPE ONE:</strong> You are at risk of going over budget</p>
